## Introduction

This web application is designed to convert Labeled Intermediate Trees to Assembly Level Language. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly experience. The application takes the input in the order of the tree and generates the corresponding assembly level language.

## Web Application Overview

The purpose of this web application is to facilitate the conversion of labeled intermediate trees into assembly level language. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Input**: Users need to enter the labeled intermediate tree in the specified order.

2. **Inorder Display**: Once the input tree is entered, the application displays the tree's inorder traversal for better understanding.

## Usage

To use the web application, follow these steps:

1. Access the web application through the provided URL or by locally hosting the files.

2. Enter the labeled intermediate tree in the specified order as input.

3. Observe the inorder display of the entered tree for verification.

4. The web application will then generate the assembly level language based on the provided tree.

## Implementation Details

The web application is primarily built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The `local_html.html` file contains the structure of the web page, while `styles.css` handles the styling aspects. The main functionality is implemented in the `cdss_f.js` JavaScript file, which acts as the backend of the application and is responsible for processing the input and generating the assembly code.

The logic for converting labeled intermediate trees to assembly level language is also provided in the `CDSSassembler.cpp` C++ file, which serves as one of the reference implementations.

## Responsive Design

The web application is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it adapts well to different screen sizes and devices. This allows users to access and use the application seamlessly across various platforms.
